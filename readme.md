A full blown web application with Node.js

The use cases
Letâ€™s keep it simple, but realistic:

- The user should be able to use our application with a web browser
- The user should see a welcome page when requesting http://domain/start which displays a file upload form
- By choosing an image file to upload and submitting the form, this image should then be uploaded to http://domain/upload, where it is displayed once the upload is finished
